ðŸ”­ You seem cool, but unfortunately most of my projects including any work on Dupper Analytics, BirbChat, and What's That Fruit! are closed-source for security reasons. If you still want to learn about them check out my website linked below or contact me directly. I will likely be making What's That Fruit! open source in the near future followed by BirbChat soon after that so check back if you're interested in those.

ðŸŒ± My Top Skills Include:
1. Software Development
2. Cybersecurity
3. Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
4. Physics/Math
5. Writing Useless Commit Messages
6. Lists in Markdown
